## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-  [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned a little more on CSS GRID through this project. I also saw myself making some mistakes when dealing with the useState hooks at some point but after some research, i was able to resolve the problem. I gained a little experience there too.

### Continued development

I plan to continue building more react projects and improve on my styling prowess and css grids as well.

### Useful resources

-  [state mistakes with react](https://www.example.com) - I was able to correct the issue i was having with the useState hooks after watching this video
